bridge
======

A very simple contract bridge program in c++, kind of a hello world caliber program.

This is more pseudo code for discussion than a real program right now.



Compile the bridge.cpp program with a c++11 compliant compiler gcc-4.8 or higher or clang++

with

g++ -std=c++11 bridge.cpp -o bridge 

or

clang++ -std=c++11 bridge.cpp -o bridge
